# reactive-dom [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tusharmath/reactive-dom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tusharmath/reactive-dom)
Reactive DOM is a really fast observable based library for building high performance user interfaces.

## Description
Virtual DOM (VDom) isn't the most efficient abstraction. It overloads the CPU with a lot of work to compute the diff and later after the diff is applied it overload the garbage collector with a lot of virtual elements to cleanup. Other major problem with most VDom implementations is â€” that there is no way to control the order of DOM updates or prioritize certain DOM updates over others.

 **Reactive DOM** doesn't use any form of Virtual DOM implementation so it doesn't need to compute any diffs. It uses **Observables** to setup the pipes initially between data sources and DOM elements. Whenever the data updates, due to the inherent reactive nature of observables, all the relevant DOM elements get updated automatically.

## Usage

**CommonJS**
```js
const {h} = require('reactive-dom')
```
**ES6 or Typescript**
```ts
import {h} from 'reactive-dom'
```

**HTML**
```html
<!-- import observable-air as a peer-dependency -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/observable-air/.dist/observable-air.umd.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/reactive-dom/.dist/reactive-dom.umd.min.js"></script>
```


## Example
```js
import * as O from 'observable-air'
import {h} from 'reactive-dom'

// A timer stream which emits a value every 1000ms
const timer$ = O.scan(i => i + 1, 0, O.interval(1000))

// A DOM stream that emits the DOM node only once
const view$ = h('div', [  // Specify children in an array
  h('h1', [timer$]),      // node h1, automatically gets updated with text
  h('p', ['Hi'])          // node p, works with non-observable values also
])

O.forEach(i => document.body.appendChild(i), view$)
```

## Hyperscript
Hyperscript or `h` is a helper function that helps in writing views in a declarative manner.

**Element with children:**
Children are passed as an array to the `h` function. They can be of type `observable` or `string`.
```js
h('div', [
  h('div', [
    'Hello World'
  ])
])
```


**Element with an observable content:**

Children can be of `observable` type.
```js
const timer$ = O.scan(i => i + 1, 0, O.interval())
h('div', [
  timer$
])
```

**Element with an observable style/attrs:**

Each element can take `attrs` or `style` to set the element's internal properties. The values for `attrs` and `style` can be either an observable or an object.
```js
const timer$ = O.scan(i => i + 1, 0, O.interval())
const color = i => ({color: `rgba(0, 0, 0, ${i})`})
const style$ = O.map(i => color, timer$)

h('div', {style: style$}, [
  timer$,
  h('a', {attrs: {href: '/home'}}, [
    'Home'
  ])
])
```

## Wish List
- Server Side Rendering.
- Apply CSS classes conditionally.
- Refactor public API to add custom plugins.
- Figure out event handling.
